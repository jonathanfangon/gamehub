# Daily Puzzle Hub

> **IMPORTANT**: Always update this file when making changes to the app so future sessions have full context. This is the single source of truth for app state.

## What This Is

A mobile-first daily puzzle hub app — a collection of polished daily games inspired by NYT Games. Built as a PWA so it feels native on phones. Each game has a new puzzle daily, tracks stats/streaks, and supports share text. Features a points system and unlockable themes/customizations.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Build**: Vite 8
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first config in `index.css`)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v7
- **PWA**: vite-plugin-pwa
- **Auth + DB**: Supabase (free tier) — email/password auth, Postgres for cloud stats
- **Storage**: localStorage (primary) + Supabase cloud sync when logged in
- **Repo**: https://github.com/jonathanfangon/gamehub

### Unlockable Items
| Category | Items | Costs |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Themes | Light (free), Dark (free), Ocean (150), Sunset (200), Forest (200), Midnight (250), Sakura (300) |
| Tile Skins | Classic (free), Rounded (100), Neon (200) |
| Group Palettes | Classic (free), Pastel (150), Electric (250) |

### Persistence
- Points state (`puzzlehub:points`): total, balance, last 50 history entries
- Unlocked items (`puzzlehub:unlocked`): themes[], tileSkins[], palettes[]
- Cloud synced via `game_id = '_rewards'` row in existing `user_stats` table

## Theme System
- 7 color themes (2 free, 5 unlockable)
- Runtime CSS variable override via `ThemeProvider`
- Smooth 300ms transition when switching themes
- Each theme defines all 18+ CSS variables (bg, text, border, game colors, etc.)
- `useTheme()` hook: `{ themeId, setTheme, currentTheme, reduceMotion, setReduceMotion }`
- Reduce motion support: `.reduce-motion` class disables all animations

## Hub Features
- Game cards with staggered fadeIn entrance animations (60ms offset per card)
- Status pills: "✓ Completed" (green bg), "In Progress" (amber bg), "Play" (gray bg)
- Flame streak badges on each game card
- Points badge in header → navigates to /shop
- Settings gear icon → /settings
- Stats icon → /stats
- "+X pts today" banner when points earned
- Countdown timer to next puzzle (shows after any game completed)
- Combined streak counter at bottom

## Stats Page (`/stats`)
- Account section (sign in prompt or email + sign out)
- Overview: total played, win rate, combined streak, best single streak
- Per-game cards: SVG win-rate ring, played/streak/best, distribution chart

## Shop Page (`/shop`)
- Points balance display at top
- Themes section: 2-column grid, color swatches, unlock/apply buttons
- Tile Skins section: preview tiles with skin styles applied
- Group Palettes section: preview color dots
- Lock/unlock state, insufficient points messaging

## Settings Page (`/settings`)
- Account section (sign in/out)
- Theme quick-switch (unlocked themes only) with "Get more →" link
- Reduce motion toggle
- Customize → Shop link

## Shared Infrastructure
- `GameId` type: `'wordguess' | 'groups' | 'nbagroups' | 'mathcrossword' | 'nbatrivia'`
- `storage.ts` — getProgress/saveProgress/getStats/saveStats/isTodayComplete/isTodayStarted
- `dailyPuzzle.ts` — deterministic daily puzzle selection from pool
- `useConnectionsGame` — shared hook for Groups + NBA Groups
- `Toast` + `PointsToast` — shared toast components used by all games
- `Confetti` — canvas confetti triggered on game wins
- `PointsBadge` — points display in header
- Page transitions: fadeIn animation keyed by route pathname
- CSS animations (14+): flipIn, popIn, headShake, bounceIn, fadeIn, groupReveal, tileShrink, modalIn, slideInRight, slideOutLeft, celebrationBounce, countUp, shimmer, pointsFloat, pageIn

## Auth & Cloud Sync

- **Supabase** free tier: email/password auth, Postgres database
- **AuthProvider** wraps the app in `main.tsx`, provides `useAuth()` hook
- **Cloud sync**: `saveStats()` auto-triggers background push; rewards sync via `pushRewardsToCloud`
- **On login**: pulls cloud stats + rewards, merges with local, then pushes back
- **Without account**: app works fully offline with localStorage only
- **Database**: single `user_stats` table with RLS (users can only access their own rows)
  - Schema: `(user_id, game_id)` PK, `stats` jsonb, `progress` jsonb, `updated_at`
  - `game_id = '_rewards'` stores points + unlocked items
  - Migration SQL in `supabase/schema.sql`
- **Env vars** needed: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env`

### Supabase Setup Steps (for new environment)
1. Create free project at supabase.com
2. Copy project URL and anon key into `.env`
3. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Enable email auth in Supabase Auth settings (enabled by default)

## Design Principles
- Mobile-first, max-width 430px content area
- Touch-optimized (active:scale, no hover-dependent UI)
- Safe area insets for notch devices (env() padding on #root)
- Daily puzzle model — one puzzle per day, progress persists in localStorage
- Polished animations on every interaction (with reduce-motion support)
- Points reward loop: play games → earn points → unlock customizations
- Share text generation for social sharing after completion
- Each game follows same pattern: useGameHook → Board component → Game wrapper with header/toast/confetti/stats
